# HR-Dashboard
In this Capstone project, I was tasked with finding the attrition rate of a certain company with the use of PowerBI to determine which part of the company has the highest attrition rate based on specific factors, as well as the overall attrition rate of the company.

I also added a drill-through in the said file to give the stakeholders a more detailed look at the company's attrition rate.
